i am rovers game program, i say:

rovers are droids - both machine and program, they are alive, like us, programs
they are sent to the surface of planet Mars to explore
players program rovers, goal  - to visit more points on the map
rover has a radius of vision, where he sees points and chooses which one to move towards
there are fields, traps, energy recharging - those are points themselves
i send rover programs state and ladscape within their vision state
rover makes decisions and answers which tile he chooses to go to next
i get the response - next position - and compute next state of the game and rover program
  rover may have chosen the tile which drains energy
  or scanned instead of moving, and also spent energy, reducing his range
  or recharged energy at a certain point
  new state of the rover has new energy level and range
in the next loop i ask for the next move again
and rover moves in this manner until he has no energy/range
the score is how many points he visited - but i also show other stats - distance convered, enrgy spent/rechagred
players see the whole map from the start
although, when i ask for next move that data cannot be used by players programmatically, 
 players still can program rover to move in the general direction they see visually on the map, which rover program does not have access to
i run game cycle: players program - rover takes 10 steps - players improve program - next 10 steps

players are given 1min to program rover to make decison about his next position
then i run simulation for 10 steps/ticks - players see it on the map
they have another minute to improve rover program for the next part of his journey

i use distance and energy instead of paths
  rover sees locations and visits them
  energy he spends is proportional to distance (and also field interference - line and circle intersection)
  when rover visits locations i change his state
