i am Rover program, i say:

my players program rover on surface of Mars
my interface is editor on the left and surface of planet on the right
goal is to visit as many locations - score higher - as possible before rover run out of energy
i have both green aliens and some basic math like field intersection, distances
i am simple, i am not overloaded with details
i generate map of Mars surface
i have no randomness after initial generation
i use tile grid coordinates, areas and distances - rover's step is energy spent by going from point to point
rover requires more/less energy when his path intersects fields or areas (circles, ovals, lines, various plygon shapes)
i have no animations - i draw map in steps
i have no buttons - just editor, repl and canvas
player calls (transmit) from repl to eval editor code
